# CarbonVPN

CarbonVPN is a new, modern and secure virtual private network server
build on top of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) and [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)

Its goal is to provide **secure** and easy to use private networking that 
makes use of the latest developments in Cryptography.
CarbonVPN does not depend on a SSL/TLS library but uses its own protocol.

CarbonVPN currently supports most Linux distro's and BSD variants.
A Windows version is already planned and will be part of the next few releases.

## Development

All project files are available through Github. Pull requests are welcome!

## Documentation

Documentation is comming soon and there will also be a Gitbook available to
cover the most basic setups.
